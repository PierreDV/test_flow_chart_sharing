# Test Workflow Chart
This repo was created to see how easy it would be to collaborate using [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/). 

### TO TEST

* Add flowchart to flow_chart directory through [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/).
* Give another collaborator access to this repo.
* See if they can open saved flow chart on [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/), edit and save to repo.

### Notes
To use the flowchart, you must visit [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/), and under github (you might need to give the app access to github) you must "Open Existing Project", scroll down till you find this repo and open the flowchart file.
